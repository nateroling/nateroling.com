        <h1>Building a 50-Year Website</h1>
        <p>What would it mean to build a website that would last 50 years?</p>

        <p>Every page should stand alone:
        <ul>
            <li>no libraries</li>
            <li>no shared styles</li>
            <li>no shared code</li>
            <li>duplicate everything</li>
            <li>static everything</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Each page should essentially be an archive, a folder with an index.html file.</p>

        <p>This is the opposite of building a maintainable site. We don't want a 50-year site to be maintainable, we
            want it to maintenance-free.</p>

        <p>You could build the site with just markdown files, and use a static site generator to build it up, but that's
            a thing that can break. Yeah, you could rebuild a new site with another generator from the original
            markdown, but would you want to?</p>

        <p>If everything broke one day, would you go through the effort to fix it before adding more content? Or would
            you give up on it?</p>
